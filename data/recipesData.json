                "cooking_method":"You can make this curry with pork, chicken, beef, lamb, goat or even shrimp. The method is the same. If you’re using chicken, make it either with a whole chicken cut up into pieces or with skinless bone-in or boneless thighs, as dark meat gets tender and fall off the bone in curries.If using beef, go for fattier marbled cuts for best results. Chuck is ideal, like any other stewToday I feel like cooking with pork. Pork shoulder or butt is ideal for vindaloo, as it cooks low and slow. The curry takes on more depth and richness as the fat renders into the gravy. That being said, for a leaner dish you can also use loin.",

                "cooking_method":"The most important thing for mouth watering, juicy, tender chicken tikkas is the perfect marination. During marination the chicken absorbs the flavors from different spices and herbs and is naturally tenderized. For this reason, you should marinate your chicken at least 5-6 hours.So if you can’t marinate overnight, I suggest starting first thing in the morning. It’s a very easy yogurt based marinade, with mostly pantry staples. If you are missing a few of the ingredients, go ahead and make it anyway, it’s going to turn awesome.",
